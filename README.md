## Overview

Almost everyone likes to go out in the sun, but if proper measures are not taken, the ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun may cause skin cancer. Without systematic sun protection, most people who may be exposed to the sun unprotected for long periods of time may develop skin cancer at the age of 70.

In order to improve this situation, **Uaway** aims to let Victorians aged 20-30 know about UV skin cancer and avoid it through simple and effective measures.
